# Modeling Host-Parasite Burdens Across Varying Parasite Sptail Aggregation, Parasite Denisty, and Host Recovery Rate

This github repository features code for an agent-based modeling approach to testing the influence of spatial aggregation of environmental parasites on parasite aggregation on hosts.

The key functions are found in the "parasite_sim_functions.R" script. They include:

1.  A function to generate binary landscape matrices of varying parasite density and parasite spatial aggregation (slow but precise).
2.  A function to move hosts across a landscape and acquire/lose parasites.
3.  A function that wraps around the second function above to run simulations of host movement on a list of landscapes generated by the first function above.

To run the model, first use the "sap_landscape_setup.qmd" document to generate a suite of landscapes for simulating upon. Then, use the "sap_simulate.qmd" document to run the simulation model on the suite of landscapes you generated. Finally, you can use the sap_figures.qmd" document to summarize and visualize the simulation results.

There are also two supplementary documents:

1.  "sap_nonspatial_supplement.qmd" compares simulation results from the "simulate" document to a non-spatial version of the model.
2.  "sap_timestep_supplement.qmd" runs simulation on a smaller subset of landscape matrices to observe trends in outcome variables across more timestep, to see when things stabilize (or don't).
